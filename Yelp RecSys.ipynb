    "Recommender systems have become an essential tool in various domains, enabling businesses to personalize user experiences and improve customer satisfaction. Collaborative filtering techniques analyze patterns of user behavior and item preferences to generate personalized recommendations.\n",
    "\n",
    "The KNN algorithm leverages the similarity between users or items to make predictions and suggest items of interest. By finding the nearest neighbors based on user-item ratings, KNN can identify similar users or items and provide accurate recommendations.\n",
    "\n",
    "On the other hand, SVD is a matrix factorization technique that uncovers latent factors underlying user-item interactions. By decomposing the user-item rating matrix into lower-dimensional representations, SVD captures the latent preferences and characteristics of users and items, allowing for more efficient and accurate recommendations.\n",
    "\n",
    "This assignment will explore the implementation of both KNN and SVD models on the popular Yelp dataset. The models will be trained using a filtered dataset containing user-item ratings, evaluate their performance using appropriate metrics, and fine-tune their parameters for optimal results. The following Business question and sub-questions has been formulated:\n",
    "\n",
    "**<span style='color:#F76241'>1.1 Main Research question:</span>** </br>\n",
    "How can we utilize collaborative filtering methods to develop business recommendations for Yelp users in the top US states?\n",
    "\n",
    "**<span style='color:#F76241'>1.2 Sub Research questions:</span>** </br>\n",
    "   \n",
    "1. Is there a relationship between the Number reviews and the ratings given to a business. If Yes? then to what extent does the Star ratings impact the reviews given to a business?\n",
    "   \n",
    "2. What are the top 10 states with the highest number of businesses on Yelp?\n",
    "   \n",
    "3. How effective is the KNN model on the business recommendations in the top 2 states with the highest number of businesses on Yelp?\n",
    "   \n",
    "4. How effective is the SVD model on the business recommendations in the top 2 states with the highest number of businesses on Yelp?\n",
    "\n",
    "5. How does the choice of collaborative filtering method (KNN or SVD) impact the recommendation quality for businesses in the top 2 states?\n",

There are fewer businesses that have more than 200 reviews. The distribution of the review counts is skewed to the right. This will be important to keep in mind when we are building the recommender system. (See the filtering section for more details)"

This visualization helps us understand which states have the highest concentration of Yelp-listed businesses and can provide insights into the geographical distribution of the businesses and help identify areas with high business activity. We are particularly interested in the top 10 states with the highest number of businesses. Nevada has the highest number of businesses listed on Yelp, followed by Ontario, Arizona, and North Carolina. We do this in two steps:\n",

    "We can see that businesses with a 5-star rating have a higher median review count than businesses with a 1-star rating. This suggests that businesses with a higher star rating tend to receive more reviews than businesses with a lower star rating. While the review count do not really differ much across the star ratings, other interesting observations include:\n",

    "- Businesses with a 2-star rating have a higher median review count than businesses with a 1-star rating.\n",

    "To answer the question, based on the plot, it is a little evident that there is a relationship between the reviews and the ratings and the significance of this relationship can be tested with a simple pearson correlation. This statistical test will be performed in the next section."

    "We use this to check the correlation between the review count and the star ratings. The correlation coefficient is 0.03 which is very low. This shows that there is no linear correlation between the review count and the star ratings. This means that the star ratings do not have a significant impact on the review count. This is also evident from the boxplot above. The boxplot shows that the review count does not differ much across the star ratings. This means that the star ratings do not have a significant impact on the review count."

    "Based on the above filtering process, it is evident that the size of the dataset has been reduced from **8021122** to **1360149** data points overall. The code below demonstrates the preparation of the Nevada and Arizona datasets to a structure the dataset for the recommender system in the following section. The following steps are used:\n",
    "- First, we create a new column called \"user_id_index\" and \"business_id_index\", then assign a unique integer value to each user_id in the dataset. we do this because the business and user ids are alphanumeric and we need to convert them to integer values for easy manipulation in the recommender system.\n",
    "- Rename the stars_y column to \"rating\" to make it easier to understand.\n",
    "- Third, we check for duplicate user_id and business_id pairs and handle them by keeping the first instance of the pair and dropping the rest to avoid problems when creating the user_business matrix. We do this instead of dropping all the duplicates because we do not want to lose the information about the rating given by the user to the business.\n",
    "- Fourth, we create a new dataframe called \"nevada_filtered\" and \"arizona_filtered\" by selecting the columns \"user_id_index\", \"name\", \"business_id_index\", and \"rating\" from the 'nevada_df' and 'arizona_df' dataframes respectively.\n",
    "- The \"user_id_index\", \"business_id_index\", and \"name\" columns are renamed to \"user_id\", \"business_id\", and \"business_name\" respectively.\n",
    "- Both dataframes are split into training and test sets using the train_test_split() function from the sklearn.model_selection library.\n",
    "- Pivot Tables are created for both the training and test sets using the pivot_table() function from the pandas library. The pivot tables are created to have the \"user_id\" as the index, \"business_id\" as the columns, and \"rating\" as the values.\n",
    "- The pivot tables are converted to sparse matrices using the csr_matrix() function from the scipy.sparse library and now ready to be used in the recommender system.\n",

    "KNN is a non-parametric, lazy learning algorithm. It is used for both classification and regression problems. It is a supervised learning algorithm which stores all the available data points and classifies a new data point based on the similarity. It is a distance-based algorithm that does not make any assumptions on the underlying data distribution. It is also called a lazy learner algorithm because it does not learn from the training set immediately instead it stores the dataset and at the time of classification, it performs an action on the dataset. It is called a non-parametric algorithm because it does not make any assumption on the underlying data distribution. In this algorithm, the value of K is very crucial. K is the number of nearest neighbors to be considered. K can be any integer. A small value of K means that noise will have a higher influence on the result and a large value make it computationally expensive. The value of K should be such that most of the times it should be an odd number. The best value of K is selected by testing using different values of K. The most common distance metric used in KNN is Euclidean, Manhattan, and Minkowski. The Euclidean distance is the most used distance metric. The Minkowski distance is a generalization of the Euclidean and Manhattan distance.\n",

    " Hyperparameter tuning is the process of finding the best set of parameters for a machine learning model. It is an important step in the machine learning pipeline. It is also called hyperparameter optimization. It is a part of the model selection process. In machine learning, hyperparameter tuning is a crucial task to improve the performance of a model. The K-nearest neighbor (KNN) algorithm is a widely used classification algorithm in various fields, including ecology (Schratz et al. 2019). Hyperparameter tuning of KNN involves selecting the optimal value of K, which determines the number of nearest neighbors to consider when making predictions. Schratz et al. (2019) evaluated the impact of KNN hyperparameter tuning on the accuracy of a species distribution model. They found that a small change in the value of K can significantly affect the performance of the model. The optimal value of K varied depending on the dataset and the specific modeling task. Therefore, it is important to perform hyperparameter tuning for each individual dataset and modeling task to achieve the best performance of the KNN algorithm. In addition to K, other hyperparameters such as the distance metric and the weighting scheme can also affect the performance of the KNN algorithm. Therefore, a comprehensive hyperparameter tuning process should consider multiple hyperparameters simultaneously (Schratz et al. 2019) <br>\n",

    " \n",
    " In the code below, we perform hyperparameter tuning on the validation dataset to find the best parameters for the KNN model. We use the GridSearchCV() function from the sklearn.model_selection library to perform hyperparameter tuning. We use the following parameters for hyperparameter tuning:\n",
    " \n",
    " - n_neighbors: This is the number of neighbors to consider when making predictions. We use the values 5, 10, 15, 20, 25, and 30 for this parameter.\n",
    " - metric: This is the distance metric to use for the tree. We use the values 'euclidean', 'manhattan', 'minkowski', 'cosine' for this parameter.\n",
    " - algorithm: This is the algorithm to use for computing the nearest neighbors. We use the values auto, brute and ball_tree for this parameter.\n",
    " \n",
    " Since we want to minimize the error between the predicted and actual values, we use the negative mean squared error. By default, GridSearchCV tries to maximize the score, so we need to negate the mean squared error to ensure that the best hyperparameters are the ones that produce the lowest error.\n",
    " \n",
    " We use the 'NearestNeighbors' model from the sklearn.neighbors library instead of 'KNeighborsClassifier' or 'KNeighborsRegressor' model for hyperparameter tuning. This is based on the fact that we are trying to find the nearest neighbors of a user or business and not trying to classify the businesses or predict the ratings for the businesses. KNeighborsClassifier is suitable for predicting discrete labels or categories, while KNeighborsRegressor is more appropriate for predicting continuous values. NearestNeighbors is a general-purpose implementation of the K-nearest neighbors algorithm that can be used for both classification and regression tasks, focusing on finding the nearest neighbors to a given data point. In this case, we are trying to find users who rated similar businesses so we use the NearestNeighbors model for hyperparameter tuning. \n",

    "\n",
    "According to Anwar et al. (2021), SVD is particularly useful when dealing with large and sparse data sets as it helps in identifying the underlying structure of data and reducing the dimensionality of the data set. The Singular Value Decomposition (SVD) algorithm is a powerful technique for matrix factorization and has many applications in data analysis, machine learning, and recommender systems. In the context of recommender systems, the SVD algorithm is used to predict user ratings for items based on their past ratings and the ratings of other users with similar preferences. The implementation of the SVD algorithm in the Surprise package offers a user-friendly and efficient tool for recommender systems. The Surprise package is a Python library for building and analyzing recommender systems that provides a variety of algorithms including SVD. The implementation of SVD in Surprise is based on the iterative optimization of a cost function that minimizes the difference between the predicted and actual ratings. The algorithm takes into account the sparsity of the data by using regularization techniques to avoid overfitting. The implementation also includes options for tuning hyperparameters such as the number of factors and the regularization parameter to improve the performance of the algorithm. The Surprise package provides a simple and flexible interface for using the SVD algorithm in recommender systems and has been used in various real-world applications with promising results (Hug).\n",

    "A general overview of how the SVD algorithm concept is given below:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Matrix representation:** Let's assume we have a user-item rating matrix R of size m x n, where m represents the number of users and n is the total number of items (such as businesses). This matrix R contains ratings given by users for various items.\n",

    "2. **Mean Centering:** To reduce bias in ratings and make data suitable for factorization, mean centering allows us to capture users' relative preferences more precisely. We subtract the mean from each row's (user's) ratings in this step of mean centering.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **SVD Factorization:** SVD divides a mean-centered rating matrix R into three matrices: U, S and VT where U is equal to Uniform Scalar Vector Differentiation and VT stands for Volumetric Vector Decomposition.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. U is an m x k orthogonal matrix representing users' latent factors. S is a diagonal matrix with singular values (strengths) ordered descendingly; these singular values capture each factor's importance.\n",
    "VT is an orthogonal matrix representing items' latent factors.\n",
    "Latent factors represent characteristics or features underlying users and items that contribute to rating systems, while their number, denoted as k, determines approximations levels of original matrix R.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Dimensionality Reduction:** To decrease the dimensionality of our matrix, we may choose to keep only the top k singular values and columns from U and VT. This approach will allow us to capture only significant factors while discarding noise or less important contributors.\n",
    "\n",
    "6. **Reconstruction:** To approximate the original rating matrix R, we can reconstruct it using reduced versions of U, S and VT matrices. The resultant matrix R' is obtained by taking its dot product; thus R' = U*S*VT\n",
    "\n",
    "7. **Predictions:** Once we have our reconstructed matrix R', we can use it to estimate missing ratings or recommend items to users. For any given user, this involves considering both their latent factors (U) and those for unrated items (VT), with our predicted rating being determined as the dot product between these factors (U + V+ T).\n",
    "\n",
    "8. **Prediction** Formula: Prediction = U[user_index,:]*S * VT[:, item_index]\n",
    "\n",
    "9. **Model Training and Evaluation:** In practice, datasets are separated into train, validation, and test sets. Train sets are used to train an SVD model by performing matrix factorization to find latent factors; validation sets serve to fine-tune hyperparameter settings by selecting an optimal number of latent factors k. Finally, test sets are used to evaluate performance by comparing predicted ratings with actual ratings and computing evaluation metrics such as Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE) or Mean Absolute Error (MAE).\n",
    "\n",
    "10. SVD provides a low-rank approximation of an original rating matrix, capturing latent factors that shape user preferences. This facilitates efficient representation, prediction, and recommendation within collaborative filtering-based recommender systems.<br>\n",

    "In the code below. the SVD algorithm is implemented in the Surprise package using the following steps:<br>\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Data Preprocessing & Surprise Library Importing**<br>\n",
    "Surprise Library is imported and Surprise's internal preprocessing transforms our Nevada and Arizona filtered datasets into suitable formats for further processing<br>\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Matrix Initialization**<br>\n",
    "Surprise initializes user and item latent factor matrices before training the SVD algorithm, representing hidden factors that describe user-item interactions data. Their dimensions depend on factors such as:<br>\n",
    "\n",
    "  - The number of users on the nevada and arizona data<br>\n",
    "  - The number of businesses on the nevada and arizona data<br>\n",
    "  - The number of latent factors (specified by the n_factors parameter)<br>\n",
    "Surprise finally initialize this matrix using small random values that may help speed up initialization time.<br>\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Training**<br>\n",
    "  - In the training phase, Surprise uses Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD) optimization procedure during its training phase to learn user and item latent factor matrices by minimizing squared errors between observed ratings and predicted ratings.\n",
    "  - Regularization terms are added to an optimization objective to prevent overfitting.\n",
    "  - Learning takes place over an iterative series of epochs with each iteration updating latent factor matrices as it progresses <br>\n",
    "  - The algorithm also calculates user and business biases to account for inherent biases in data, learning these biases during its training phase alongside its latent factor matrices.<br>\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Rating Prediction**<br>\n",
    "Once the SVE model has been trained, it predicts ratings for yelp users in the given region. To provide accurate predictions for any user-item pair, the following steps were followed:<br>\n",
    "\n",
    "  - Calculate the dot product of the user's latent factors and the item's latent factors.<br>\n",
    "  - Add the user and item biases.<br>\n",
    "  - The resulting value represents the predicted rating for the user-item pair.<br>\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Model Evaluation**<br>\n",
    "Surprise utilizes Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE) metrics to assess the accuracy of predictions made by our SVD model, by comparing predicted ratings against actual ratings in the test set.<br>\n",
    "\n",
    "6. **Business recommendation**<br>\n",
    "The SVD model recommends businesses to users based on their predicted ratings. The top 10 businesses with the highest predicted ratings are recommended to users.<br>"

    "<b><span style='color:#F76241'>Sub-Question 3: </span>How effective are the KNN models on the business recommendations in Nevada and Arizona?</b><br>\n",
    "Nevada and Arizona businesses were recommended using KNN models. The KNN model was able to recommend businesses with an RMSE of 0.79 for the Nevada Businesses and 0.73 for the Arona Businesses.\n",

    "<b><span style='color:#F76241'>Sub-Question 4: </span>How effective are the SVD models on the business recommendations in Nevada and Arizona?</b>\n",
    "Nevada and Arizona businesses were recommended using SVD models. The SVD model was able to recommend businesses with an RMSE of RMSE: 1.2139 for the Nevada Businesses and RMSE: 1.2392 for the Arizona Businesses.This implies that, on average, the predicted ratings from the SVD model deviate from the actual ratings by approximately 1.2 units. Comparing this with the KNN model's RMSE, the SVD model has a higher level of error and lower accuracy in predicting ratings.\n",

    "<b><span style='color:#F76241'>Sub-Question 5: </span> How does the choice of collaborative filtering method (KNN or SVD) impact the recommendation quality for businesses in the top 2 states?</b><br>\n",
    "Based on the RMSE values, it can be inferred that the KNN model performs better in terms of recommendation qualities compared to the SVD model. The lower RMSE of 0.7 suggests that the KNN model provides more accurate and reliable recommendations, indicating a better overall recommendation quality. On the other hand, the SVD model with an RMSE of 1.2 may have limitations in accurately predicting user preferences and could potentially result in less precise recommendations. The KNN model outperformed the SVD model. The RMSE of the KNN model was lower than that of the SVD model. This demonstrates that the KNN model outperforms the SVD model. Therefore, KNN positively impacts the recommendation quality more than the SVD <br>\n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, to answer the main business question **'How can we utilize collaborative filtering methods to develop business recommendations for Yelp users in the top US states?'**, The KNN model is more resilient than the SVD model. This is due to the fact that the KNN model makes no assumptions about the underlying data distribution. The SVD model requires normally distributed data. The KNN model is also easier to understand than the SVD model. This is how easy the KNN model can be conveyed to non-technical persons. Non-technical persons will struggle to understand the SVD model. In addition, the KNN model is more scalable than the SVD model. This is because the KNN model does not require any training. The SVD model requires training. The KNN model is also more flexible than the SVD model. It is also noteworthy to note that the SVD models generally took longer than the KNN models to compute both the models and test it.\n",
    "\n",
    "In conclusion, it is important to note that other factors such as data quality, scalability, and specific application requirements should also be considered when evaluating and choosing the most suitable recommender model for a given scenario. "
